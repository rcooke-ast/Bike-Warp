# Bike-Warp

If you want to play this fun and addictive game, simply download the BikeWarp.jar, commons-io-2.6.jar, and java-json.jar files and use a terminal to execute the command:

```java -cp BikeWarp.jar:commons-io-2.6.jar:java-json.jar com.mygdx.game.desktop.DesktopLauncher```

(or you can use the script `run_on_commandline.sh`). You don't need the source files (i.e. you don't need to clone the repo) if you just want to play. You only need to have java installed on your system, and download the above files.

Have fun - and I welcome your feedback!!
