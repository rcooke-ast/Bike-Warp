# Bike-Warp

If you want to play this fun and addictive game, simply download the BikeWarp.jar, and double click to open it. If you prefer to use a terminal, you can instead use the command:

```java -jar BikeWarp.jar```

You don't need the source files (i.e. you don't need to clone the repo) if you just want to play. You only need to have java installed on your system.

When you run the game for the first time, it will create two folders (`levels` and `replays`) and two data files (`BGstate.dat` and `WorldRecords.dat`), So, you might want to put `BikeWarp.jar` in a folder so all of the game files are located in one directory.

Have fun - and I welcome your feedback!!
