# Bike-Warp

If you want to play this fun and addictive game, simply download the BikeWarp.jar, and open it. If you prefer to use a terminal, you can instead use execute the command:

```java -jar BikeWarp.jar```

You don't need the source files (i.e. you don't need to clone the repo) if you just want to play. You only need to have java installed on your system.

Have fun - and I welcome your feedback!!
