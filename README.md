# Bike-Warp

If you want to play the addictive and fun game, simply download the BikeWarp.jar file and either double click it to run, or if you prefer to run programms on the command line, use the command:

```java -jar BikeWarp.jar```

You don't need the source files (i.e. you don't need to clone the repo) if you just want to play.

Have fun - and I welcome your feedback!!
