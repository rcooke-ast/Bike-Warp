# Bike-Warp

If you want to play this fun and addictive game, simply download the BikeWarp.jar file and either double click it to run, or if you prefer to run programs on the command line, use the command:

```java -jar BikeWarp.jar```

You don't need the source files (i.e. you don't need to clone the repo) if you just want to play. You only need to have java installed on your system.

Have fun - and I welcome your feedback!!
